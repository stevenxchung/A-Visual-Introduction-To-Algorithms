# Asymptotic Notation

For the functions, $n^k$ and $c^n$, what is the asymptotic relationship between these functions? Assume that $k >= 1$ and $c > 1$ are constants.

A: $n^k$ is $O(c^n)$

For the functions, $lgn$ and $log_8n$, what is the asymptotic relationship between these functions?

A: $lgn$ is $Î˜(log_8 n)$
